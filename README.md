Name
    Austin Smith - Portfolio

Description

    This is a simple portfolio of some of the projects that I have done so far for General Assembly. It is responsive to being resized and scales down to cell phone size.

Installation

    I didn't have to install anything except linking bootstrap jquery and reset.css and my reglar css file

MVP

    I needed to get the basic functionality of the website down, so having all of the nav buttons work as well as it resizing the content to fit a smaller screen. There are many ways of getting the content from the spreadsheets, so I ended up hard copying the info down just so that I would have the website up and ready to go to show off to clients. All of the links work and are responsive and dynamic. I was able to complete the different sizes of the portfolio with bootstrap and styled it with css. It took about 10 - 12 hours, so I was over my mark by a couple hours. It took me much longer to do the jquery and javascript than it did navagation or styling, so my timeline was off.

Support, Authors, and acknowlodgement

    w3, addtoany, mdbootstrap, unsplash, and a special thanks to Google, Jim, and Brock who spent an hour with me only to realize that i spelled src "scr"

Contributing

    I would gladly take any contributions or advice, especially with the jquery.

Project status

    Unfortunanately, I do not think I would ever have enough time to really be happy with my website. It is one of those things where I will nitpick and continue to add random functionality forever unless I am stopped. I will update it with more projects though or swap some of the ones out that I have.
